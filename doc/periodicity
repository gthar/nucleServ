Description:
 Periodicity in nucleosome positioning along the gene.

Details:
Score is a measure of the phase between the first and the last nucleosomes.
Specifically it is computed as the residue of the nuc.length divided by the
period (165 bp).
Therefore a score of 0 means the nucleosomes are completeley phased and a
score of 82 corresponds to totally anti-phased nucleosomes.

Autocor is computed directly from the experimental coverage and is a
quantitative measure of the periodicity of the nucleosomes inside the
gene-body.
