The coverage corresponding to a single nucleosome call can be fitted to a
gaussian distribution according to three parameters: m, sd, and k.

k is the height of the curve's peak.
m is the position of the center of the peak.
sd is it's standard deviation and controls the width of the bell.

Additionally, as stiffness constant for the given nucleosome can be derived
from the sd of the gaussian function.
